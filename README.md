## Overview

**TermSense** is an AI-powered monitoring platform for **payment terminals**. Instead of waiting for merchants to report issues, TermSense proactively tracks terminal health, detects anomalies, and provides **root cause analysis** with the help of **Google Gemini API**.

The platform helps operations / support teams stay **ahead of escalations** by automatically identifying issues, drafting proactive communication to merchants, and streamlining ticket resolution.
